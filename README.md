# Object detection using deep learning with OpenCV and Python in Docker
OpenCV `dnn` module supports running inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks like Caffe, Torch and TensorFlow. 

When it comes to object detection, popular detection frameworks are
    * YOLO
    * SSD
    * Faster R-CNN

Support for running YOLO/DarkNet has been added to OpenCV dnn module recently.
